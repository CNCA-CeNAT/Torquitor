# Torquitor

## Synopsis

Torquitor is a simple yet effective web interface for pbsnodes and qstat. It uses a python daemon to obtain the information from pbsnodes and qstat and displays the information in a web interface through a php service.

## Motivation

The pbsnodes and qstat tools display very useful information, yet their console display is not quick or comfortable to use, the alternative web interface shows information from every node, and every running job in a clear, easy to the eye web interface available for every user of the cluster.

## Installation

Just copy the package and run the install script, follow the steps in the process. 
Torquitor requires pbsnodes, qstat, python, apache or nginx and php 5.x already installed in the server, it also requires super user permissions to run properly.
